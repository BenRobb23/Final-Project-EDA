## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r dataframes}
# Load data from CSV files
df1 <- read.csv("episodes.csv")
df2 <- read.csv("sauces.csv")
```

```{r define column nams}
# Define column names
column_names_df1 <- c("Season", "Episode_Overall", "Episode_Season", "Title", "Original_Release", "Guest", "Guest_Appearance_Number", "Finished")
column_names_df2 <- c("Season", "Sauce_Number", "Sauce_Name", "Scoville")
```

```{r column names}
# Assign column names to dataframes
colnames(df1) <- column_names_df1
colnames(df2) <- column_names_df2
```

```{r explore sauces dataset}
# Explore and analyze sauces dataset
data_dir <- 'data'
target_file <- file.path(data_dir, 'sauces.zip')
```

```{r explore episodes dataset}
# Explore and analyze episodes dataset
dataf <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-08-08/episodes.csv")
```

```{r merge datasets by season}
# Merge data from both datasets
merged_data <- merge(df1, df2, by.x = "Season", by.y = "Season")```
```

## Including Plots

```{r Bar plot}
# Bar plot of participants' completion levels
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = Finished)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "purple") +
  labs(title = "Participant Completion in 'Hot Ones' Show", x = "Completion Status", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r Scatterplot}
# Scatterplot matrix
pairs(select(merged_data, Finished, Episode_Season, Scoville), cex = 0.7)
```

```{r Correlation}
# Correlation heatmap
correlation_matrix <- cor(select(merged_data, Finished, Episode_Season, Scoville))
corrplot(correlation_matrix, method = "color")
```

```{r Boxplot}
# Boxplot of spiciness by season
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = as.factor(Season), y = Scoville)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Spiciness Distribution by Season", x = "Season", y = "Scoville")
```

```{r Violin plot}
# Violin plot of ability to complete challenge vs. spiciness
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = Finished, y = Scoville)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "green") +
  labs(title = "Ability to Complete Challenge vs. Spiciness", x = "Ability to Complete Challenge", y = "Scoville")
```

```{r Time series plot}
# Time series plot of spiciness and ability to complete challenge
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = Original_Release, y = Scoville, color = Finished)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Time Series of Spiciness and Ability to Complete Challenge", x = "Original Release", y = "Spiciness Level", color = "Ability to Complete Challenge")
```
