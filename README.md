# Final-Project-EDA

<!-- DH general comments

- This readme is empty; use it to introduce your project, give any setup instructions. 

- The project doesn't have clear organization.  There are three different `R`/`Rmd` files.  What does each one do?  Are they supposed to be run in a certain order?  

- You skip most of the steps of Peng and Matsui's checklist.  There are several moments where — even with an understanding of what your project's about, which your code reviewer won't have — I don't understand why you're doing certain things.  

- Think of an EDA as giving a tour of the data.  Here's this dataset, here's where it came from, here's how it's organized, here are some notable features.
